# Pay Concourse Runner with java 21

This Docker image identical to the original [governmentdigitalservice/pay-concourse-runner](https://github.com/alphagov/pay-ci/tree/master/ci/docker/concourse-runner) but with Java 21.

Once our Java apps are upgraded to Java 21 we can deprecate the `concourse-runner` and `concourse-runner-with-java-17` Dockerfiles.
